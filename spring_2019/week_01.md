## Last Week's Accomplishments

This is my first semester in RCOS, so I spent most of the first few weeks getting set up. This included:

* Attending Git Workshop, learning git, practicing it extensively
* Setting up Petitions site locally
* Setting up Elections site locally
* Beginning to learn Django (used on Petitions site)

I began to make some progress on these projects as well:

* Opened PR for text changes for upcoming elections (https://github.com/wtg/elections/pull/98)
* Reviewed Petitions wiki and opened issue for broken links (https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/issues/21)

## This Week's Plan

My plans for this week:

* Finish Django tutorials
* Review current code for petitions
* Work with others to better understand how Elections backend works
* Clean up issues section on Elections repo

## Anything Blocking?

None

## Notes

My main project will be Petitions, but I also plan to work on the Student Government Elections site (through the Web Technologies Group) as well.
